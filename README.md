# MNIST Computer Vision Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my first project in the field of computer vision! This project is centered around the MNIST dataset, a classic in the field of machine learning and a great starting point for anyone interested in understanding and applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop and train a convolutional neural network to accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project serves as an essential stepping stone in my journey of mastering computer vision techniques.

## Key Learning Objectives

- **Understanding CNNs**: Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how convolutional neural networks function and how they can be applied to image recognition tasks.
  
- **Familiarization with MNIST**: The MNIST dataset, being one of the most iconic datasets in machine learning, provided me with a hands-on opportunity to work with image data.

- **Experimentation and Optimization**: I experimented with various CNN architectures and tuning parameters to improve the model's accuracy.

## Use of External Data

In addition to the standard MNIST dataset, I have utilized external data available through `keras.datasets`. This additional data was instrumental in enhancing the model's performance and improving my final score. The integration of this external data provided a more robust and diverse training environment for my neural network.

## Conclusion

This project was not only a valuable introduction to computer vision but also an opportunity to familiarize myself with the intricacies of convolutional neural networks. The use of external data from `keras.datasets` played a significant role in the successful completion of this project.
