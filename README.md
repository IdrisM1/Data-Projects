# Spaceship Titanic: A Cosmic Data Science Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.

The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

Help save them and change history!

## Project Phases

This project consists of several key phases, each critical to understanding and solving this interstellar mystery:

### 1. Data Exploration
   - **Initial Assessment**: Analyzing the available data to understand its structure, content, and any patterns or anomalies.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Preparing the data for modeling by handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries.

### 2. Hyperparameter Optimization
   - **GridSearch Implementation**: Utilizing GridSearch to find the optimal hyperparameters for our models, ensuring better accuracy and efficiency.

### 3. Neural Network Experimentation
   - **Simple Neural Network**: Building and testing a simple neural network to familiarize myself with its architecture and functionalities.
   - **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing the neural network's performance in predicting the outcome.

### 4. Model Selection
   - **Final Model Choice**: After experimenting with various models, selecting the best one to predict "which passengers were transported by the anomaly."
   - **Model Training and Validation**: Fine-tuning the chosen model to maximize its predictive accuracy.
