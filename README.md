# Project Repositories Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is organized to showcase various projects, each residing in its own dedicated branch. Here's a quick guide to help you navigate through the repository:

## Branch Structure

Each branch in this repository represents a unique project. The contents of each branch are as follows:

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: This is where the main analysis, coding, and visualization for the project are contained. The notebook includes detailed comments explaining the code and the thought process behind each step.

2. **Data Archive (7zip File)**: All the necessary data files for the project are compressed into a 7zip archive. These files typically include CSV files containing the data used in the project. The 7zip format is chosen for its efficiency in compressing large datasets.

3. **Kaggle Submission File**: This is a CSV file that has been submitted to Kaggle for evaluation. It contains the results/output of the project, formatted according to Kaggle's submission requirements.
